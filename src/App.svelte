        <li>Include a copy of the Repair Contract with all your export documentation</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Write 'REPAIR & RETURN' on the commercial invoice in the General Description or Remarks section</li>
        <li>Indicate the value of the product <b class="emphasis">INCLUDING</b> the cost of the repair under the Detailed Description of Goods section </li>
        <li>Include the original shipping documents or tracking number from when the item was first exported to Italy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be sure to write the necessary information on the commercial invoice according to the document checklist below. </p>
      <h5>Repair Checklist</h5>

      <h3>Temporary Imports</h3>
      <p> Goods shipped to Italy that will be returned to Canada are called temporary imports and qualify for entry without payment of duties or taxes. </p>
      <p> Temporary imports will be allowed to stay in Italy up to 24 months, but for some products the time limit will be less. </p>
      <p>Goods that are often part of a temporary import include:</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Materials and goods to be used for entertainment or during a public exhibition such as a trade show booth</li>
        <li>Items that will be used or displayed at a fair, exhibition or event</li>
        <li>Commercial samples</li>
        <li>Scientificand professional equipment</li>
        <li>Equipment required to evaluate and test the operation of other goods and equipment</li>
        <li>Tools and specialised equipment required for repairing, exploring, producing or manufacturing</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Temporary admissions are expected to follow the rules below:</p>
      <ul class="check-mark-list">
        <li>The goods will be returned to Canada unchanged aside from normal wear-and-tear</li>
        <li>If they remain in Italy, then duties and VAT must be paid</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Qualifying for Duty & Tax Free Temporary Import</h4>
      <p>In order to import your goods duty and tax free into Italy, you can pick from 1 of the 2 Temporary Import Methods listed below.</p>
      <p> Each option has its pros and cons. Regardless, each of the following methods requires you to complete a Commercial Invoice (CI). More details <a href="#temporary-import-ci-only" class="smoothScroll" title="Temporary imports CI in Italy" rel="noopener">below</a>. </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="font-weight: 700">1. Complete a Commercial Invoice Only</div>
        <p>
          <br /> This is the simplest and quickest option. <a href="#temporary-import-ci-only" class="smoothScroll" title="See example of how to declare a Temporary import on your commercial invoice for your boxes or parcels to Italy">See example</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">NOTE:</span> You should be aware that shipping using this method doesn't guarantee that your items will be imported duty/tax free. Not all brokers will clear goods as temporary imports (i.e. UPS, Fedex, DHL), nor is it a guarantee that customs won't charge any duties and taxes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div style="font-weight: 700"> 2. CI + an ATA Carnet </div>
        <p> This option is great for items that frequently travel in and out of the country. It's also great because once you have an ATA Carnet, it is accepted by 176 countries worldwide making the application process a one-time thing. </p>
        <p> In addition to declaring your commercial invoice as a temporary import, you can get an ATA Carnet for the items that are of temporary nature. </p>
        <p> ATA Carnets are beyond the scope of this article. You can however, contact your local chamber of commerce and they will be able to guide you along. You can also find more information here: <a href="http://www.chamber.ca/carnet/" title="ATA Carnet�.

        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>In addition to the 2 options listed above, the following <b class="emphasis">conditions</b> must also be met in order to qualify for a duty and VAT free exemption: </p>
      <ul class="check-mark-list">
        <li>The goods arrive and leave in the same condition, allowing for normal wear and tear; maintenance and minor repairs are allowed under certain conditions</li>
        <li>Stay no longer than 24 months in Italy</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b class="emphasis">NOTE</b>: <br />
      <ul>
        <li>If the above conditions are not followed, duties and taxes will be charged as though the goods have been imported permanently</li>
        <li>Your Customs broker can clear goods of a temporary nature, however FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc. typically <b class="emphasis">cannot</b> clear goods of a temporary nature. </li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Permanent/Sold Goods</h3>
        <h4>Occasional Shipper</h4>
        <p>If you ship occasionally to Italy (i.e. items you sold on eBay), there isn't too much you need to do. You will need to:</p>
        <ul class="check-mark-list">
          <li>Include 3 copies of the Commercial Invoice with your shipment</li>
          <li>Provide a detailed description of the goods on the Commercial Invoice (in order to avoid customs delays)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b class="emphasis">NOTE</b>
          <br /> An Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number is NOT needed if you are shipping as a private individual.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Regular Shipper</h4>
        <p>If you regularly sell and ship goods to Italy, we recommend you consult a licensed customs broker in Italy.</p>
        <p> You may need to comply with certain requirements, such as obtaining an <a href="https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/customs/eori/eori-number/assignment_of_eori_number/" title="Assignment of EORI number in Italy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI)</a> number. </p>
        <p>Duties and taxes will have to be paid by the importer. These will be calculated on the value of the goods plus shipping and insurance costs. </p>

      <h2>Duty & Taxes</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Import duties and taxes in Italy are calculated based on the sum of the Customs Value, Insurance Amount, and Freight costs (shipping costs). This is known as CIF.</p>
    <div class="duty-formula">
      <h5 class="cif-formula">CIF Value = Customs Value + Insurance Amount + Freight Costs </h5>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Using the CIF value, you can predict how much the duties and taxes a recipient in Italy will have to pay on a shipment from Canada.</p>
      <br />
      <h5>Thresholds</h5>
      <p> Italy has de minimis values for duties. This means that a shipment with a CIF value below &#8364;150 (about $250 CDN), no customs duties are charged. VAT is incurred on a shipment regardless of its value. </p>
      <p>
        <b class="emphasis">NOTE</b>: Alcoholic beverages, perfumes, and eau de toilette are always subject to VAT, duties, and excise taxes.
