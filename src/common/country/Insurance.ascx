        through Secureship and it is provided by the carrier that will be transporting your shipment.
    </p>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Each carrier will charge a different amount per $100 of declared insurance. If you indicate that you need insurance for your shipment our system will automatically include the insurance costs for your shipment.</p>
        <p>Insurance is great to have in case your package is accidentally lost or damaged by the carrier. But be careful, not everything you ship is insurable. Worse - even if your package contains items that are insurable, if it doesn&#8217;t meet the ISTA 3A packaging standard, the insurance purchased through the carrier would not be available to you.</p>
        <p>Here are some items that cannot be insured by the carrier:</p>
        <ul class="grid-items">
            <li>Personal belongings</li>
            <li>Antiques</li>
            <li>Artwork</li>
            <li>Liquids (including alcohol)</li>
            <li>Televisions</li>
            <li>Jewellery in excess of $500</li>
            <li>Perishable goods</li>
            <li>Glass or Ceramic</li>
            <li>And many more items</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, please see the carrier's terms and conditions.</p>
